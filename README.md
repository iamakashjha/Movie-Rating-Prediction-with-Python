# Movie-Rating-Prediction-with-Python
In this project, I built a model that predicts the rating of a movie based on features like genre, director, and actors.

I analyze and predict movie ratings, encountered various data challenges, such as missing values, typos in column names, and duplicated records. Through a series of data cleaning and preprocessing steps, I successfully prepared the dataset for analysis.

The analysis uncovered several interesting insights about the movie dataset. I observed trends in movie durations, genre popularity, the most prolific actors and directors, and the distribution of movie ratings and votes over the years. Notably, I found that short-duration movies tend to receive higher ratings and votes, and the Drama genre has consistently performed well in terms of ratings.

Furthermore, the evaluation of machine learning models revealed that Random Forest outperformed Linear Regression, with an impressive R-squared score of 0.94 on unseen data, highlighting the model's robustness.
